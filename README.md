<h2> 🧠 About Me: </h2>
Hey there! I’m Jason Mosley, a CompTIA A+ certified technician with a strong interest in IT and hands-on technology. I'm currently growing my skills and experience to pursue a full-time role in the tech industry, with a drive to continue learning.

This GitHub is where I document my learning journey. You’ll find virtual labs where I walk through real-world tasks like SSD installations, Windows setup, and small office/home office (SOHO) network configuration. I take pride in not just completing these tasks, but breaking them down in a way that’s clear, helpful, and replicable.
I’m passionate about learning by doing and always looking for ways to sharpen my skills, solve problems, and stay curious about what’s next in tech.
